# Intro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was created as part of a code-challenge interviewing for FE position at Dwarf and had to be completed within 48 hours.

# Run and build instructions

- `npm start`: boots up the development build on http://localhost:3000.
- `npm build`: creates a production optimized build
- `npm test`: in principal, this runs a test-suite, but I haven't written any tests so it won't do much :)
